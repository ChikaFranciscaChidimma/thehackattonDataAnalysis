What Success looks Like

A query about “what is the best performing brand in Abidjan" should return a result which
shows the brand with the most volume sales as calculated from the provided dataset.
Submission will be graded on responsiveness of the chatbot (speed and conversational ability),
accurate calculation of returned values, aesthetics of the tool and the ability to provide extra
information relevant to the query.

Accurate calculations are crucial for the success of this challenge, as they directly impact the
quality and reliability of the chatbot's insights. The chatbot should be able to answer questions
about retail performance based on the provided dataset. This may involve calculating sales
performance, percentage changes, and market share metrics

The chatbot should be able to handle a variety of queries, including;

© Product sales trends over time (e.g. What were the top-performing brands in
the last quarter?)

Comparison of sales performance across different cities (e.g, What was the
performance of BRAND A compared to BRAND Bin each quarter in the
various cities)

© Market View: What is the market size in each quarter?
