THE CHALLENGE

The challenge is to build a prototype of a data analysis tool for large datasets on market
performance, with a chatbot interface that will return values (texts, chats and tables) based on
user input in the chatbot

Content of the Datasets for the challenge

For this challenge, you will be provided with an Excel dummy dataset on Noodles. The
dataset includes the following metrics:

«Product Information: Detailed descriptions of various noodle products, including
brands, type, packaging, and price

«Sales performance of each SKU

«Inventory level: Stock levels of each SKU.

«Pricing information: Pricing data for each SKU.

What Success looks Like

A query about “what is the best performing brand in Abidjan" should return a result which
shows the brand with the most volume sales as calculated from the provided dataset.
Submission will be graded on responsiveness of the chatbot (speed and conversational ability),
accurate calculation of returned values, aesthetics of the tool and the ability to provide extra
information relevant to the query.

Accurate calculations are crucial for the success of this challenge, as they directly impact the
quality and reliability of the chatbot's insights. The chatbot should be able to answer questions
about retail performance based on the provided dataset. This may involve calculating sales
performance, percentage changes, and market share metrics
